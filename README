Build container:

docker build -t example-apache:debian-stable .


Get IP of container:

docker inspect <container name> | grep IP


Take the IP provided by the above command, and connect to the
apache server with the following command:

https://<IP>:80


It's supposed to work with just "https://localhost:80", however
it doesn't let me connect & that' all beyond the scope of this.
